# The-Music-Player_Project
This C++ project implements a simple music playlist management system that allows users to manage their music playlists effectively. The system provides functionalities to add, remove, display, and play songs from the playlist. The user can also navigate through the playlist to play the next, previous, first, last, or a specific song.
